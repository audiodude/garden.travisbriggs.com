# Python

I first started writing python in 2009, in my first Github repo: [sudoku-solver](https://github.com/audiodude/sudoku-solver), an open source library for solving Sudoku puzzles that I did in my free time (I had a lot of free time back then because I was unemployed and living in my parents' basement).

Soon after I got my job at [[Qwobl]] with Jawad and [[Christian]] and Joe, where I wrote a lot more python code. I don't think they ever told me this, but I think they looked at the sudoku code when considering me for the job.

Python has remained one of my favorite programming languages. I would say I'm probably slightly more proficient in it that [[javascript-typescript|Javascript/Typescript]], which is what I use for my [[YouTube|day job]].
