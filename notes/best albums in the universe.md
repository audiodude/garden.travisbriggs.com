# The Best Albums in the Universe
I think I started this project in 2011 or 2012. It was originally on Tumblr. It lives on the web at [bestalbumsintheuniverse.com](https://bestalbumsintheuniverse.com) and on Gemini at [gem.bestalbumsintheuniverse.com](gemini://gem.bestalbumsintheuniverse.com).

When I was coming up with the name, I knew I wanted to keep track of a curated collection of my favorite albums, mostly for my own reference. But I thought it would be lame to be like my-favorite-albums.com or something like that. Why not go big and call it Best Albums in the Universe?
