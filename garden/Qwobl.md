Qwobl was the smallest startup I ever worked for, and I've worked for a lot of startups. It was only 5 people total, including me. The cool part of that was that there was a **lot** of room to learn and experiment, with no one breathing down your neck. There was nothing that was "somebody else's responsiblity" or "someone else will take care of that". If things were to get done, we had to push our comfort zones and learn how to do them ourselves. It was a formative experience for me to work there, and I made friendships that have lasted for years and to this day ([[Christian]]).
