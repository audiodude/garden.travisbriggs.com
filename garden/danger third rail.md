title: The garden band
---

[Danger Third Rail](https://dangerthirdrail.com) is the name of my "band". But as I always explain, "band" is in quotes because it's mostly just a recording project of myself, recording music in my [[recording-setup|home recording studio/kitchen]]. All of the tracks I've produced and [[DistroKid|published]] to [[Spotify]] feature [Emily Dolan Davies](https://emilydrums.com/), and they've all been professionally mixed and mastered by [other](https://soundbetter.com) [[Fiverr|people]]. But I've written all the songs 100% myself, sang them all, played guitar and keyboards on all of them, and bass on all but one.

Currently, Danger Third Rail is on something of a hiatus. I've written about a dozen song for my first full length album, and I've recorded demos of all the songs. I started taking mixing lessons so I could mix and master the songs myself, to make the album 100% DIY. However, the mixing lessons were hard and hard to keep up with. I haven't felt like at my current skill level I could do the songs justice. At the same time, I don't want to spend thousands of dollars to get them professionally mixed and mastered, since I've made a grand total of about 50 bucks ever selling music (and from Spotify/iTunes/Amazon/YouTube payments).
