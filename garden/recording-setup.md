I have had some different recording setups over the past 20+ years I've been making digital music. The one I'm using now is in a corner of my kitchen and is based around a personal computer and digital composing/recording/editing. It's been the same for about 10 years now, which is the amount of time I've lived in the same apartment in San Francsico.
