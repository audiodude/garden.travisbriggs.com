This is my attempt to distill and repeat what I consider to be the most important principles of digital gardening. These are taken mostly from the following sources:

* [Maggie Appleton - A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)
* [Joel Hooks - My blog is a digital garden, not a blog](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)
* [Andy Matuschak - Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C)
* [Shawn Wang - Digital Garden Terms of Service](https://www.swyx.io/digital-garden-tos)

From these and other sources, I've figured out that a digital garden should have the following properties, and embody the following principles. I will expand each of these into its own garden node for further investigation.

* [[dg-public|Digital gardens allow for learning in public]]
* [[dg-solo|Digital gardens don't need attention to thrive]]
* [[dg-evergreen|Digital garden posts are unfinished, or evergreen]]
* [[dg-status|Digital gardeners are upfront about a post's status]]
* [[dg-reverse|Digital gardens eschew reverse chronological sorting]]
* [[dg-feedback|Digital gardens allow and respond to feedback]]
* [[dg-new|Digital gardens aren't afraid of something new]]

Note that all of these are phrases, statements even. I'm trying to follow the principle of Evergreen Notes that [Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C?stackedNotes=z6bci25mVUBNFdVWSrQNKr6u7AZ1jFzfTVbMF).
