Yes, I know I need to [add comments](https://github.com/audiodude/garden.travisbriggs.com/issues/13) to this garden. I think it's critical, given the fact that [[dg-evergreen|digital garden posts are unfinished, or evergreen]] and [[dg-public|digital gardens allow for learning in public]]. Since it's happening in public, comments should be made in public. And since the nodes are supposed to be evergreen, it's important that people can comment and point out things that have gotten out of date or that don't mesh well with local reality.
