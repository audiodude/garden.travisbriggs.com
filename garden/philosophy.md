I don't have a ton of opinions on philosophy. I consider myself something of an existentialist, because I believe that life and existence are absurd and without inherent meaning. We must create our own meaning. However most days it's hard for me to actually picture [Sisyphus happy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Sisyphus).

I don't believe in free will. I am a determinist. I believe there is plenty of evidence that "free will" is the name we give to the process by which our conscious mind explains to itself why it did something.

I'm also an [[atheism|atheist]], which probably deserves its own article.
