I don't have a ton of opinions on philosophy. I consider myself something of an existentialist, because I believe that life and existence are inherently absurd and without inherent meaning. We must create our own meaning. However most days it's hard for me to actually picture [Sisyphus happy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Sisyphus).

I'm also an [[atheism|atheist]], which probably deserves its own article.
