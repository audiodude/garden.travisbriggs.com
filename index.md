# A digital garden...

Hi, I'm [Travis Briggs](https://travisbriggs.com) and you've stumbled upon my [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). Or maybe you were forced to come here by the various military robots I have deployed across the web, who knows.
Either way, welcome! If you're interested in what I'm thinking or working on, feel free to browse through the [garden](garden/), which is arranged kind of like a knowledge graph of pages. You should be able to use the backlinks to find other pages that linked to the page you're reading.

I'm trying to [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) here, so join me if you'd like. The idea is to take my daily [morning pages](https://littlecoffeefox.com/morning-pages-changed-life/) and/or daily journaling, and extract bits that are interesting to discuss publicly. Then I will hopefully link some of these concepts together and grow the garden over time.

I'd also eventually like to host a version of this page on [Gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/). (coming soon!)

The source code for this garden is [available](https://github.com/audiodude/garden.travisbriggs.com), and I'm tracking [issues to improve it](https://github.com/audiodude/garden.travisbriggs.com/issues). It is based on [Eleventy Garden](https://github.com/binyamin/eleventy-garden) which is based on [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).

Welcome!
